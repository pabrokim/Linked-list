# Linked-list
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point” to the next node by means of a pointer.

Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node in the list.

A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last node in the list. Below is a basic representation of a linked list:

[ NODE(head) ] -> [ NODE ] -> [ NODE(tail) ] -> null

LinkedList class / factory, represents the full list and contains functions.

Node class / factory, creates a value property and a link to the nextNode, initially set as null.
